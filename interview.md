### 1. First Interview with Recruiter

The first interview was very basic and straightforward. I was asked some basic questions.
- Introduce yourself
- Your previous responsibilities
- Your current responsibilities
- Programming Skills and experience
- Contest/Problem-solving experience
- Strengths and weaknesses
- Desired salary work conditions

After 3/4 days, I was introduced to this position by the recruiter who asked if I am interested. And then he forwarded a coding test via email.

### 2. Coding Test

#### Stage 1

The coding test consisted of 5 questions. It was on hireroo.com. The given time for the test was 100 mins.

1. Given a list of N triangles with integer side lengths, determine how many different triangles there are. Two triangles are considered to be the same if they can both be placed on the plane such that their vertices occupy the same three points.
2. Given an array of meeting time intervals consisting of start and end times[[s1,e1],[s2,e2],...](si< ei), find the minimum number of conference rooms required.
3. ASCII Encoding of a string by Replacing each character with its ASCII value representation and reversing the string. Once reversed, retrieve the original one.
4. Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return true if it is possible to divide this array into k non-empty subsets whose sums are all equal.
5. Partition Array Into Two Arrays to Minimize the Sum Difference


#### Stage 2

This stage had multiple MCQ questions. Questions related to AWS (Web app access control), TCP/IP, GIT, Kubernetes, and docker-related basic questions
These were scenario based questions. Given a scenario/issue what would be the appropriate action.

### 3. First Interview with the company

#### Q/A Session
it was an almost 2-hour long interview. In the end, I was exhausted. During the first 60 minutes, all the questions were asked from my previous projects.

1. How did you implement the detection system of the robot? (One of the projects that I have done in my previous company)
2. They showed some issues and asked if I have handled them. How did I handle them?
3. Some features were not implemented in my project. Why? Who made the decisions?
4. Suppose one of your teammates has made a mistake and you need to change all of your code or imagine he did something else and now you need to change your whole source code which took a month to build and to adopt his you need to change your code and re-do everything again. How would you handle this situation?
5. How did you manage your tasks as a team leader?
6. What kind of challenges did you face and how did you solve them?
7. How does non-maximum suppression work?
8. Asked lots of technical questions from my previous projects (classification models, transformers, HRNet, ML System Design, etc)
9. How would you compress an image and upload it and decompress it? (Explained Huffman Coding)

#### Coding test
This was a progressive coding test. The interviewer shared an online google doc. At first, I was asked to write an SQL query to retrieve some data (operations required to join, select, and count). Don't remember the query. I wrote the query on a google doc.
1. Given a list of processes (process_id, status: active/inactive), group them by active/inactive keeping the id order the same. I wrote the code on google docs, used python
2. Tell us the time complexity of your code  
3. Remove the inactive processes by in-place operation  
4. Explain the time complexity
5. Optimize it by shifting the inactive ones to the right and keeping only the active ones
6. Explain the time complexity
    - Here he disagreed with my answer and explained why. Then I explained my point. At first, I was confused but then I let him explain first by asking can you explain it, please.
7. Optimise your code again for nLogn complexity
    - Couldn't do it because of time.
    
Interview ended.
